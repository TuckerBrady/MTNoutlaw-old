               <h2>Tight Lines and Ripped Lips.</h2>

                <p class="lead">It's the best of times, it's the worst of times. That's how I like to describe chasing trout in the heat of the Summer. Let's see if we can't use this weather to our advantage! </p>
                
               <p class="drop-cap">The main form of trigger panic derives from what I call 'anxious aiming.' This occurs when the pin settles in where you want it to and you feel like you have to fire that release immediately. Or, you start to slip into the habbit of touching off the trigger as the sight wobbles over the center of the target. Over time, you develop a hardwired connection between your trigger finger and your eye, and that connection takes time. Think about it, from the time your mind tells your finger to fire that shot, to the act of your finger actually doing it, is enough time to move off your mark.  Now, you may say you don’t have trigger panic, but if you can’t aim in the middle and slowly fire that shot, then I’ve got some bad news: YOU'VE GOT TRIGGER PANIC. Luckily, I'm here to help. </p>
               
               <h4>Know Thyself.</h4>
               <p>You are probably wondering to yourself, "Self, how can I solve this? That's good! We want to use our brains, to get them to work for us. The fact is, the problem lies between your ears, not in the act of shooting. What you need to do is commit several weeks to the cure; every day or every chance you get, hold your release. It needs to become an extension of your hand. Get to know every click it makes, every scratch on it, everything about it. Know when it releases and exactly how much tension it takes to get there. Once you're comfortable with your new appendage, Move on to the next phase.</p>

               <h4>Mental Reps.</h4>
               <p>I don't care what it is, if you're wanting to improve, getting your mental reps in is key. I once heard a story of a Prisoner of War. Before the war, he was an avid golfer. After his liberation, when asked how he coped with everything, he replied that every day, he would play his favorite golf course in his head. Visualizing every part of his game and the the course. His first time back on the course, he shaved 4 strokes off his game! We will apply this same pricipal. When you're laying in bed, before you fall asleep, you need to think about your shot; EVERYTHING about your shot. From nocking the deathwhistle, to drawing your string, finding your target and putting just enough tenstion on your release to send that sucker down range. Watch your arrow go down the range, how is it flying? What kind of arch does it have? What's the weather like? Are you standing on dirt? Grass? A hill? You need to go over every detail in your mind. Send several arrows down range and hit your mark. Studies have shown us that as we sleep, our brains will work on and solve problems we were working on before we fell asleep. Let's use that to our advantage and work on our trigger panic in our sleep!</p>
               
               <h4>Let's Get Physical.</h4>
               <p>So you've been doing your mental reps and you're ready to take the next step, well, go out in the yard or range with an arrow nocked, just like you would normally practice. Simply draw the bow and address the target, aiming with your finger on the trigger – but don’t pull that release; you want to focus only on aiming. Keep that pin where you want to the arrow to hit until your aiming starts to break down. Then let down and reset, never firing the arrow. Treat this just as you would any practice session, except never actually shoot your bow. This will do two things that benefit you greatly as an archer. First, it will teach your mind that it is OK for that pin to settle on the bulls-eye without firing that arrow. Second, it will increase the length of time during which you can effectively aim before your shot breaks down. Over time, you will be able to add shooting back into your routine, but if you ever feel those anxious or rushed feelings, take a few days and just commit to this simple drill.
               </p>



               <p>Trigger panic is a horrible thing, and if you don’t know how to cure it, it can really mess with your confidence, taking the fun out of shooting your bow. Even if you aren’t struggling with trigger panic (you do), these practices will help you stay calm, even in the most intense circumstances. 
               </p>
