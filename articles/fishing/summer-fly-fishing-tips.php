                <h2>Tight Lines and Ripped Lips.</h2>

                <p class="lead">They say you forget your troubles on a trout stream, but that's not quite it. What happens is that you begin to see where your troubles fit into the grand scheme of things, and suddenly they're just not such a big deal anymore.</p>
                
                <p class="drop-cap">Summer is here and that means eager anglers are hitting the water. After the cold days of winter and high waters of spring, the golden months have arrived. Insects are hatching, fish are feeding, and the weather is great.

                While summer is most people’s favorite season to fish, it does require changing up your techniques from previous seasons. Before you hit the water in the summer sun, make sure you brush up on your summer fly fishing techniques!</p>
               
                <h4>The early fish gets the fly. Also, the late fish gets the fly.</h4>
                <p>There’s more than one reason it’s a good idea to avoid the hottest parts of the day. First of all, the fishing will probably be a little slower than in the morning and evening. In the morning, temperatures are cool, fish are active, and insects will start emerging. In the evening, big hatches can happen. Clouds of caddises can be seen in the evenings of hot summer days, and mayfly spinner falls will be causing fish to go nuts.</p> 

                <p>While there are definitely still insects that’ll come off in the middle of the day, the early afternoon when temperatures are highest will probably be a little slower fishing than early or late. Fish will often take a little siesta and hold off if it’s really hot, and although you may still catch some, evenings and mornings will produce better results.</p>

                <p>In addition to the actual fishing, the wellbeing of the fish is also an issue in summer. Once water temperatures get too warm, fish start to struggle. They get less oxygen and need to take it easy until the water cools down. If you catch a fish in warm water, there’s a decent chance it won’t make it after being released, especially if it took a while to land.</p>

                <p>Fishing late in the evenings once the water has cooled a little is better, and the best option is to fish in the morning after a long, cool night. These fish have a much better chance of surviving than those caught in the summer heat.</p>

                <h4>Hit the riffles.</h4>
                <p>When it comes to Winter Fly Fishing, you want to target the deep, slow runs of the river. The fish are probably feeling some of that seasonal depression; they're letargic, and dont like to try and compete with those faster runs.</p>

                <p>In the summertime though, it's a whole different ball game! The slow deep pools in the river will most likely be warmer, and have less oxygen than the quicker moving water. The fish will also have the energy they need to sit in the fast water, slurpin' those bugs! Now, this doesn't mean you can only fish the fast runs, but definitely think twice about avoiding those shallow, quicker riffles. They can be great places to scoop some fish!</p>
               
                <h4>Dress for success.</h4>
                <p>In addition to searching for colder water to find active trout, you owe it to yourself to stay cool. Remember the well-known angler tenet: the more comfortable you are, the longer you're likely to be active and casting.
                In your efforts to remain cool, consider wet wading. Don short pants and your regular wading boots worn over thick socks. Let the cooler water work for you. And if you absolutely must have something between you and the water, wear lightweight, breathable fishing waders.
                Other optional gear is a mesh fly fishing vest or even better, a fly fishing chest pack. Just be sure to wear a breathable shirt, possibly with a vented back.</p>


                <h4>Don't live in the past.</h4>
                <p>We often use our past experiences to make our decisions instead of looking at the current conditions and making a decision based on that first. I’ve said it for a while to people I come across, 'confidence flies' can be a really bad thing for most of us anglers. The problem with 'confidence flies' is that we often choose them at the car when we rig up and forget about trying to figure out what the river and trout are doing that day. Elk hair caddis catch a lot of fish and deserve a spot in everyones box, but that doesn’t mean you should blindly tie one on and then fish it for half of your day just because “it worked for you last time you were here”.</p>

                <p>If you use the past as your primary influence on your decisions, you’re going to miss fish.  Rivers are always changing, you should be aware of this and make sure the current conditions match your past experiences before you just go for that confidence bug or confidence hole.</p>

                <h4>Pro Tip!</h4>
                <p>Before you snap that pic for your followers to adore, dip that guy back in the water and pull him out right before you take the picture. Not only will this be less stressfull for the fish, but the water will make him glisten in the light. Guarenteed to get you more likes. Every time.</p>
